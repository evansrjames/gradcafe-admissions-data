I was really surprised when I received the offer yesterday. It feels hard-earned after so many rejections! I will be taking the offer. For those who haven't received an offer yet and the people who will be seeing this next season, it's not over until you receive the official rejection. So don't give up hope even if it's too late!
GPA:7.0/8.0(distinction in my university). LOR's: I don't know how strong they were. Three summer internships and a Bachelor's and Master's thesis (Ours is a dual degree).No publications, no presentations. My project advisor is one of the pioneers of the field.

Your application was very carefully reviewed by a committee of faculty experts in the program you applied to.  It was also reviewed by the Graduate College.  Most programs on campus admit only a small subset of the students who apply.  In this very competitive process, it is inevitable that many talented and qualified students are not admitted.


I understand that this decision will be extremely disappointing to you.  However, I hope that you continue to endeavor to reach your goals, and wish you well in your educational pursuits.

Thank you for considering the University of Florida for your graduate study.  Our selections committee has now completed the reviews of all applications to our graduate program.  I regret that we were unable to offer you admission.  We had nearly 500 very competitive applications this year and the committee had to make many difficult decisions.  Ultimately, we have to decline hundreds of very well qualified students.  I hope you will have an opportunity to continue your studies at another institution and wish you the best with your future academic endeavors.

The Committee on Admissions has carefully reviewed your application for admission to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. I am sorry to inform you that your application to the PhD degree program in Chemistry has not been approved.

The number of people we can admit each year for graduate study is quite limited. Unfortunately, because of intense competition, we must in many cases deny admission even to highly qualified candidates.

In many cases we are unable to offer admission to highly qualified candidates because of limited space and facilities, or because their interests do not coincide sufficiently well with the needs and interests of our faculty.

We have concluded our reviews of nearly 700 applications for our fall, 2011 PhD class in chemistry.  It was an exceptional pool of applicants this year and it was very difficult to select only 50 new students for our program.  We obviously must decline hundreds of very well qualified students.  I regret that your application was not among those recommended for admission by the selection committee.  I hope you will have an opportunity to continue your studies at another institution and wish you the best with your future education.  I must also apologize for being unable to write to you personally but the volume of applications makes this impractical.

Sincerely,

Dr. Smith"
