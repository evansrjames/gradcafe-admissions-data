After carefully reviewing your application, the faculty has decided that they are unable to grant you admission. As you know, Caltech is a small school and as such we are able to admit only a small percentage of the applicants who apply each year. In many cases we are unable to offer admission to highly qualified candidates because of limited space and facilities, or because interests don't perfectly fit with the needs and research focus of our faculty. 

Your record and qualifications are very good, and we have no doubt of your ability to earn an advanced degree and that you will have a successful career.  We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

Double majored in M.E. and Math at a pretty alright university (ranked like 70-ish nationally), POI said double major was a big plus. Had a few years of research experience with publications. For future applicants: big emphasis on GRE quant score, my verbal score was probably a fluke but I ended up retaking quant (bumped it from 166 to 170) on professor's advice.

The department receives a very large number of applications and can only admit a limited number of students. We have to turn down many qualified candidates who are capable of excellent achievement. For the 2018-19 admissions cycle, we received 569 applications for a target class size of 32. After reviewing your file the admissions committee was unable to recommend that you be admitted to the program.

 

Due to the large volume of applications we received this year, we cannot accommodate providing feedback on individual decisions.

 

We will keep your 2018-2019 electronic application materials on file for 2 years; however, if you wish to apply again in the future, you will need to submit another Graduate Admissions online application.

 

Despite this outcome, we hope that you are able to pursue your studies elsewhere, and wish you well in your future endeavors."

This will depend on the responses to our initial set of offers, 
and also upon the permission of our graduate dean.

Most likely, we will not receive many responses to our offers during 
March.  In April, we will contact those who have not responded, asking 
them to reply quickly if possible.  Our hope is that we will hear back 
from most of them before April 15, so that we will be in a position to 
make additional offers at that point if appropriate.""

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is small and highly selective, with a limited number of places available in each of its graduate programs. It strives to find the best possible fit between the interests of each applicant and the expertise of our faculty. Each year we find that we must reject a number of excellent students, certainly qualified for graduate study, but who would not find their needed resources at Brandeis. Both the admissions committee and I regret that we are unable to accept a larger number of qualified applicants.
I appreciate your interest in Brandeis and wish you well in the future.

If you get asked about whether you want to be nominated for a university fellowship, the best response is this: ""I am very interested in Berkeley but I do have a competing offer from another top program and funding will factor into my decision."" (You are unlikely to get a fellowship if you say that you will definitely come to Berkeley, that you will probably not come to Berkeley or that finances won't influence your decision. Judging from last year, you also won't get a fellowship if you give a vague response that does not address the fellowship question.)"

a very good mathematician. However, it also noticed   gaps in your
undergraduate preparation that would need to be filled before you would
be ready for our doctoral program. The usual course of action in such
cases is admission into our Master's program with financial support. I
had  hoped that we would be able to do this in your case.  However, this
year we have fewer than our usual number of openings, and we have not
admitted ANY students into our Master's program with financial support.

There is a tiny chance that this state of affairs will change, but not
before the April 15th deadline for acceptances of offers. It truly pains
me to have to contact  applicants like you with anything less than good
news, but at this time is appears that we will be unable to make you an
offer with financial support"
