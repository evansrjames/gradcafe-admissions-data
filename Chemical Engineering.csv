My profile is what I mentioned in the earlier post, nothing much to boast about other than one okayish publication. I guess I could say that if I stand a chance, you do too!

After carefully reviewing your application, the faculty has decided that they are unable to grant you admission for academic year 2012 – 13. Caltech is a relatively small school and as such we are able to admit only a small percentage of the thousands of applicants who apply each year. In many cases we are unable to offer admission to highly qualified candidates because of limited space and facilities, or because interests do not match the needs and interests of our faculty. 

Your record and qualifications are very good, and we have no doubt of your ability to earn an advanced degree and that you have a successful career ahead of you.  We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. 
Best Regards,

Our admission committee appreciates the significant time and effort that you and your recommenders made to submit your application for admission to our Ph.D. Program.  

Our committee members carefully reviewed your application.  Each year, the number of applicants seeking admission to the Ph.D. program in Chemical Engineering far exceeds the number of available openings, with the result that the competition for admission is very high.  We have had some difficult choices to make and do regret that the department is unable to offer you a place in our entering Ph.D. class of 2011-2012.  Thank you for your interest in Stanford University, and the rest of the faculty join me in wishing you the best in your pursuit of Ph.D. studies elsewhere."
