If he is busy and does not like to reply emails, it is possible that he requested someone to send everybody an email about the approximate timeline of application and some general information, automatically through the application system. It is easy to do it. As a director, he should have known the feeling of applicants as well as the fact that applicants received other offers of admission with deadline of making a decision. Each applicant pays application fee and the master students self-support themselves.

At last, in mid-June, I received a rejection letter from their department, when I had got everything ready for attending another institution. Maybe a great approach to get a huge amount of money is to create a virtual department/program website and writes as if it really exists. There is no need to hire a staff, an admissions director, or professors. Just create some introductions and photos of people, as well as e-mail addresses and phone numbers.

The materials you submitted with your application have been carefully reviewed by the admissions committee, but we are unable to recommend you for admission.

The UC Berkeley campus has a strict enrollment ceiling, and we are thus very limited in the number of new students we may admit each year. The admissions committee has the difficult task of selecting students with the strongest overall records from a large pool of well-qualified applicants. Unfortunately, this may result in not being able to accept many applicants who are capable of excellent academic work.

We appreciate the interest you have shown in UC Berkeley and wish you success in achieving your academic goals."

Many of the professors did not know the names of their students or what they have done following their graduation. This is BAD. If you decide to accept their offer, congratulations and I wish you luck. They are encouraging students to pass their qualifying exams as soon as possible and renew funding every 9 months.
