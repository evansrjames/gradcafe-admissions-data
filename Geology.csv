They commonly accept research-based applications (PhD and MS) as non-thesis/professional MS acceptance, forcing you to find your own funding. There is *no guarantee* you will find TA or RA funding, as TA positions have become increasingly hard to come by in the Geology Department, and this is often not told to newly accepted students. It is possible to convert from PM (non-thesis) to MS-thesis, but again, there may not be funding available. And the courses for those two degrees barely overlap. Use caution in accepting without funding. Nothing in guaranteed, only trust when promised in an official letter of acceptance or some formal writing."

You have until 4/15 to resign from your funded acceptance if you choose another program. After 4/15, again, you need to be officially released from the offer, so contact the school. Keep in mind that offers will be made after 4/15 as the majority of students will have decided by then, but the chances of funded are generally decreased. I wish everyone the best."
