I'm very concerned about the quarter system in UCLA, as opposed to the semester system at Gatech, as I'm more used to the latter. I'm also very interested in the biomedical field, and that is said to be one of the best at Gatech. At the same time, the courses at UCLA for my track seem to be a better fit! Not to mention location and job opportunities. But I'm told that it really doesn't make too much of a difference after you graduate. But yeah, I think the Quarter system is what is holding me back. As for Michigan VS UCLA, I guess the most important thing is fit? I feel they are equally good in terms of rankings...it depends on funding and what kind of specialization you are looking for.  If it's signals and systems, I'd recommend UCLA, but I think Michigan is really famous for embedded, in which case I'd suggest you go for that. In any case, there is no right choice, and I'm sure you'd be very successful no matter what you choose. Good luck!"

Your application indicated your interest in the area of Signals & Systems. Signals & Systems faculty reviewed your application and recommended you for admission. Once you accept the offer of admission and enroll with UCLA, you will be expected to focus your studies in the area to which you have been admitted. In early July, the department will assign academic advisors for applicants who have completed the SIR (Statement of Intent to Register) with confirmation of intent to enroll with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of UCLA.""

Please note that our fellowship and assistantship awards are extremely competitive for Graduate students entering your first year of study, and that no separate application was required on your part in order to be considered for the fellowships and assistantships available to our newly-applying students. The admissions committee evaluates applicants concurrently for admission and financial support, and consideration does not require you to contact us directly in order to have your application evaluated for a fellowship or assistantship.

 

Please note that If you do not receive an award of financial support for your first year of study, it is important not to get discouraged. Once you take the classes of the professor(s) you’re interested in working with, and they are able to survey your achievement, this allows you to be considered for funding in your second year. Students usually find your supervising professor in your second semester, which avails you the opportunity to join his or research group, which increases your chances of receiving a fellowship or an assistantship.

 

Please note that the University International Office will need your Form for Certification of Financial Responsibility in order to create your Form I-20 (immigration docu*ent). The amount can be shown in a fixed deposit. It is ok to have anyone be your sponsor, as long as we have a letter from him stating that he will financially support your education abroad. If you have any further questions about the cost of attendance or completing your CFR Form and financial affidavit, please do not hesitate to contact the University International Office"""

He told me how ECE admissions works is they accept people with funding immediately then everyone else basically has to wait around for individual professors to decide who they want to fund for MS. But after bugging him a few times, he told me he could accept me without funding in MEng and I'd try to find funding from individual professors for MS on my own. If you find yourself stuck and just twiddling your thumbs waiting around, talk to him but he's terrible with e-mail so also try contacting individual professors for research and if they answer back, maybe try to get them to ask Dr Plassmann for you about MEng.

Anyways if you are still waiting for a decision, don't lose hope. I had to wait for almost 4 months but didn't lose hope keeping in mind that they didn't reject me yet. So, all the best to everyone of you. Keeping praying to the Almighty and don't lose hope.

I have received an admit from European University but waiting on this one to decide.

To the poster regarding PhD decision, yes it is possible that the grad committee could deny your application even if  recommended by a faculty member.

Yes of course if the application is recommended by faculty it gets noticed and chances of admission are pretty high. Hope you get a +ve result. ATB."

When your decision is posted, you will receive an email prompting you to check it. We expect many more acceptances, so your continued interest is appreciated. 

If you submitted your application before February 1, you will receive your decision by May 1, or by the latest May 15. Many applicants should receive their decision sooner than this. 

If you submitted your application after February 1, you will receive your decision by June 1 or by the latest July 1. Many applicants should receive their decision sooner than this. 

In explanation, note that during this year's admissions cycle we received a record number of applications from highly qualified candidates. Therefore it is taking our faculty admissions committees a bit more time than usual to conduct their reviews. 

We hope that you understand this situation. We are very sorry for any frustration or inconvience this delay may cause you. You will know your final decision we hope very soon.

Later I came to know that it was because one of my recommendation as well as TOEFL score reached them after application deadline which is really firm in their case. Learned from it, and this year completed my application well before deadline to receive acceptance in late-Feb (among the first to be rendered acceptance). Interestingly both the applications were exactly same in all aspects. So if you still await response, I suggest you ensure whether all your app material reached them in time. If not, then it will be a reject in every possibility, because even if they consider reviewing applications completed after deadline, it happens after April 15, and that too with lower priority than applications kept on hold from normal in-time pile."

Your application for admission to graduate study in Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Irvine has been given serious consideration by the admissions committee. We must regretfully notify you that your application to our graduate program for Fall 2013 has been denied.

In view of the large number of well-qualified applicants and the limited number of spaces available, the admissions committee must be selective in making its recommendations. The selection process is one of identifying those applicants who are best qualified for a specific graduate program, based upon a review of each applicant's file and number of openings in the research programs in that field. Your academic preparation and scholarship, letters of recommendation, expressed interests and objectives, and other supporting materials in your file have all been taken into consideration during the committee's review process.

Although we are unable to act favorably upon your application, we appreciate your interest in our graduate program."

I don't mean to deter you from applying, but I thought it might be helpful information as I know it costs around $200 per application from overseas with all the materials you have to mail in. Also, at least your GRE quant score has to be very high, but I suppose that is already almost a guarantee if you're going to an IIT or Tsinghua. Hope that helps."

(5yrs support from UT, 1yr RA from GaTECH and 1yr RA from Wisconsin) I know Wisconsin is famous in the areas of Computer Architecture ... but the overall level in the areas of Computer Engineering is way better at UT-Austin, so any suggestions?"

For this particular fellowship the university is supposed to tell the department by tomorrow who got it.  But I have no clue how long the department will take to forward the decision to me. I'm sure that some fellowships take even longer to hear on.  I wouldn't worry about not hearing anything.

""Sorry to bear bad news, but you have not been admitted.
Our admission system has a preference for students who do not already
have an MS, which worked against you to an extent. In addition, this
year we have been restricted to fewer students than in past years by the
University administration. Although your case was under consideration up
to the last stage of decision making, the competition proved very intense.
I hope you have other good choices to fall back upon.XXX mentioned
you were talking to XXX at MIT; I hope that works out."""

Dear Tailai Wen,

I am truly sorry to inform you that we are not offering you admission to M.I.T. in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

The number of applicants for admission to the graduate school greatly exceeds the number which can be accommodated, and it has been necessary to refuse admission to many fine applicants.

We appreciate your interest in M.I.T. and sincerely hope that you may be able to continue your professional studies elsewhere."

In spite of the fact that you were among the group of top applicants, I regret to inform you that you have not been selected to receive financial aid.  This is due in part to an unusually high number of applications, and the limited availability of funds for international students.

 

It is our understanding that you would be unable to attend Washington University without financial aid; therefore, you have not been admitted to our program.  Please contact us if you are able to furnish your own support and would like to be considered for admission without financial aid.  The amount of support required for academic year 2006-2007 academic year is $41,366.
