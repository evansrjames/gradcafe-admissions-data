However, we feel that you might be interested in another graduate program that ME has partnership with.  It is the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) program in Mechanical Engineering and Management, which is administered and managed through Engineering Professional Education, one of the divisions of the Purdue College of Engineering.  We have referred your information to them, and they will contact you soon to introduce the program and the application process.

The admission decision for M.Eng will not be based on acceptance from any of the supervisors rather will be on your academic record and references (experience in relevant field would be added advantage)"

The main ways for Master’s students to get tuition support are through GSRAs (research assistant) and GSI (teaching assistant) positions.  Both of these are typically something that Master’s students apply to engage in for their second term rather than first term, since in most cases in-person interviews will have to be conducted, and students don’t arrive on campus in time to be able to do those interviews for the Fall term. Also, for GSRA positions, many faculty will ask that the student do an independent research project (ME 590) with them during the Fall term, and if that goes well, they may fund them during the second term, but they won’t commit to funding them up front without knowing how the student will perform.
 
On the positive side, if you do research with a professor and they decide after a term or two to support your admission to the Ph.D. program, at that point you will be given a full funding package that pays full tuition+stipend+benefits for 4 years.
 
Unfortunately, education loans available at the University of Michigan are only available for U.S. citizens whether they are need-based or not. As an international student, you need to look for a financial resource back in your home country."

After carefully reviewing your application, the faculty has decided that they are unable to grant you admission. As you know, Caltech is a small school and as such we are able to admit only a small percentage of the applicants who apply each year. In many cases we are unable to offer admission to highly qualified candidates because of limited space and facilities, or because their interests do not coincide sufficiently well with the needs and interests of our faculty.

The materials you submitted with your application have been carefully reviewed by the admissions committee, but we are unable to recommend you for admission.
The UC Berkeley campus has a strict enrollment ceiling, and we are thus very limited in the number of new students we may admit each year. The admissions committee has the difficult task of selecting students with the strongest overall records from a large pool of well-qualified applicants. Unfortunately, this may result in not being able to accept many applicants who are capable of excellent academic work.
We appreciate the interest you have shown in UC Berkeley and wish you success in achieving your academic goals.

The number of admission offers available at Princeton for entering graduate students is extremely limited, and we cannot offer admission to all applicants who are well-qualified. Indeed, many departments consistently have applicants who would be admitted without hesitation if additional resources were available. Our decisions take into account not only the applicants' merits but also the suitability of the programs to the candidates' expressed interests. Our goal is to achieve a sound match between the strengths of our programs and the interests of the relatively small number of outstanding students that can be accommodated.

To the Purdue poster on June 27, I don't think that the climate will be an issue but I totally agree with the rest of the points. I have also withdrawn my application. Spring decisions are out in Dec so there is a strong possibility that we can also miss out on deadline for Fall 16 (after looking at the delay for Fall 15) application as well, which is Dec 15 this year. So no point waiting for a decision for Spring on the same carried over application that they rejected this time. So, I have withdrawn mine."

We have moved your application to Spring 2016.  Your file is complete, so there is nothing else for you to submit.

My advice to you is if you contact faculty, you might want to attach any updated resume, recommendation letter, etc."

You were a strong applicant for the program.  We were holding your application to give the ME faculty the maximum chance to offer you financial assistantship.  Unfortunately, the faculty was not able to offer financial support at this time.  We would be happy to re-consider your application for Spring 2016.  If you have accepted an offer from another university, please let us know, and we will withdraw your application.  We wish you the best with your future graduate studies.

    To complete your application file, we still need the following docu*ents from you:
    - We would need a copy of your Bachelor's degree diploma from the University of Kerala.  The diploma must state that you received the degree and the date that you received it. The diploma does not need to be an original copy.  You can scan it and e-mail it to us at: megradapps@purdue.edu.

    - Your GRE scores will expire on September 15, 2025.  To be considered for possible admission in Spring 2016, you will need to retake the GRE exam and have your new scores sent to Purdue.  You have until November 1, 20215, to complete your file."

Dear [my name]:


I just wanted to let you know your application is still with the admissions committee.  There is no definitive time when they expect to finish but I will keep you updated and of course, if a decision is made, I will notify you promptly even if it is off hours or on the weekend.

We had a highly unusual number of applications this year and it has taken longer than normal for the faculty to review all the applications.

We appreciate your patience.

The materials you submitted with your application have been carefully reviewed by the admissions committee, but we are unable to recommend you for admission. The UC Berkeley campus has a strict enrollment ceiling, and we are thus very limited in the number of new students we may admit each year. The admissions committee has the difficult task of selecting students with the strongest overall records from a large pool of well-qualified applicants.

The Admissions Committee viewed your qualifications quite highly.  Regretfully, however, there are not sufficient openings.  As you may know, the admissions process in our department is a two-step process.  First the Graduate Advisor reviews applications regarding qualifications.  Those applications that pass the first step, as was the case for your application, goes to the second step where they are reviewed for support in the form of a graduate assistantship or fellowship.  Admission is not offered in cases where such support is not available.

You applications was extremely positively received and I would be very happy if you could come to Brown for your PhD.

However, it is our policy that we only admit students who we can guarantee financial support, and unfortunately, at the moment, we do not have research support for you to come to Brown and so your application has been placed on ""hold"".  This situation may and often does change, and if financial support becomes available, I will be sure to let you know.  If, at that time, you are still interested, we will be able to offer you admission to the PhD program.

I remain hopeful that we will see you in Providence, but in the meantime, I appreciate your patience"""
