Even if BU is your top choice, you could hear from them at 11:59 on April 15th or not, and if you do not and you did not matriculate elsewhere then you ruined your chances at the other school. Best bet is to wait until the beginning of April, and if you have an acceptance elsewhere, ask to be taken off of the BU wait list, which gives others who may have no acceptances a better shot.

We realize you must be eager to know the status of your application decision. At this time, faculty have contacted students of interest and have conducted interviews towards making admission recommendations and funding offers. If you have not been contacted, you might pursue other opportunities you have received. If you were previously contacted by a BME faculty member, we would encourage you to reach out to them if you are still interested.
 
Applicants will be notified by email from the Purdue Graduate School once final decisions have been recorded. The Weldon School doesn’t set a specific date on which this will occur for BME and IBSc applicants, but likely by the end of March or early April.

I am emailing you to provide an update on our process. Our Graduate Admissions Committee has been busy reviewing applications and is currently in the process of contacting and interviewing students who we feel would be the best fit for our program. We are still early in our admissions process, so no definitive actions have been taken. If you have not yet been contacted by a faculty member interested in your application, it is possible that based on your qualifications, there may not be a good match with our program and your goals as a graduate student.

I realize that you would like a definitive answer on the status of your application, unfortunately we are early in the recruiting process and I am unable to provide that to you at this time. It is quite possible that our faculty will want to pursue your candidacy as a graduate student in our program in the near future. However, if other options present themselves to you I would encourage you to pursue them.

Thanks for your interest in the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University. """
