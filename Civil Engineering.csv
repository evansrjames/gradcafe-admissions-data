CEE is one of their two larges graduate departments. Second, don‚Äôt get me wrong here. My comment was not bitter but a suggestion for those who haven‚Äôt got a decision as of now like me (I think it was more like a compliment to Stanford). Not trying to turn this result report page into a discussion forum, but: 1. Obviously if we are not considered as strong as the ones who have got in earlier, I see no reason clinging to this school instead of moving on at this point. 2. A friend of mine went to Stanford said there is always a long line in front of professors office not asking about class but waiting to ask them for research positions since everyone there want one, but these positions are limited so they often get ignored - pretty much the same thing happened to the ones trying to email and call during admission process. So in short, the competition is for sure tougher at Stanford because of its being prestigious. Cheers and good luck to all who got in!"
"Stanford","Civil Engineering", Masters (F18),Other , Other,26 Apr 2018,,,,,,O,26 Apr 2018,"Going to apply for PhD next year. Not sure whether the 500 student population is true, but quick math: a lot of them are already PhD (that's for sure- tons of research labs there), and many are second year ms students. That will leave roughly half of them or less are first year ms students. So only ~250 incoming students every year for such a big department with all these different concentrations? I think that tells the high quality and good opportunities there. Also was told by the admission people that each discipline in CEE takes less than 40-50 students each year."

The materials you submitted with your application have been carefully reviewed by the admissions committee, but we are unable to offer you admission.

The UC Berkeley campus has a strict enrollment ceiling, and we are thus very limited in the number of new students we may admit each year. The admissions committee has the difficult task of selecting students with the strongest overall records from a large pool of well-qualified applicants. Unfortunately, this may result in not being able to accept many applicants who are capable of excellent academic work.

Re:  Application for Graduate Studies
    Your application for admission to our graduate program has been received and
carefully considered by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
I regret to inform you that the Department is not able to recommend your admission
to the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research.
    We receive many applications each year and the Graduate Studies Admissions
Committee takes every effort to evaluate each application objectively for a
limited number of spaces.  Failure to be admitted to our graduate program does
not reflect upon your professional qualifications but rather reflects the intense
competition for graduate positions.  The decision was based on the strong competition
for very few openings. 
    Thank you for your interest in the University of Alberta, and best wishes
for your future career plans. 
 
 Yours sincerely,
 
 N McDonagh for the,
 Associate Chair (Graduate Studies)"

Thank you for your letter.  After careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me
an admission in your department. 

This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large number of rejection letters.  With such a varied and promising field of candidates, it is impossible for me to accept all refusals. 

Despite Whitson's outstanding qualifications and previous experience in rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not meet my needs at this time.  Therefore, I will get admitted in your department this August.  I look forward to seeing you then. 

Best of luck in rejecting future applicants.
