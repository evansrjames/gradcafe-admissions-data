So 3 publications in the wings, which doesn't help at all. No GRE submitted/ taken, 3.43 GPA held down by a 2.0 GPA (33 credits)  from my first years in college. If only my most recent GPA was considered (after 4 years off of college) it would be a 3.8 GPA.  It is complemented all together by an all together GPA for science and math of 3.7. But this gets into the weeds and schools hate the ""weeds"" in my experience. Self Identified as a Gay student with ""a male partner"" in one of my essay responses. So happy for all those who received an interview. I wish you all the best as this program is amazing and I hear Seattle is the best!

This is for other people who are worried about whether they will be taken seriously among other people with their Master's degrees and who have dedicated their post-undergraduate years to research and field work. I was admitted to the program without a Master's degree, and I did not spend any time after undergrad working in the field or doing intensive research. I graduated in 2013 and have worked in several industries since, including docu*entary film and government. I conducted research and field work during undergrad. I currently work in an environmental government sector, and I also volunteer in a genetics lab.

Early in the admissions cycle, I reached out to two professors with whom I was loosely interested in working. I set up several phone interviews with one, who continuously had to cancel them last minute and then never got back to me in the end. I ultimately schedule a phone interview with the second professors, which was also postponed once, but I did finally speak to him and our interests matched well and he said he would like to organize a visit for me. After this phone call, I reached out to him a few times to schedule a visit but he never got back in touch. Then I received a rejection letter pretty late in the cycle (3/28), which I wasn't surprised by and I had already long given up on this school because the practices seemed very unprofessional. In any event, I accepted an offer from my top choice, so either way, I am happy for those of you who have found a home at this institution and I hope that they have been more accommodating for you than they were for me. :)"

The materials you submitted with your application have been carefully reviewed by the admissions committee, but we are unable to recommend you for admission.
The UC Berkeley campus has a strict enrollment ceiling, and we are thus very limited in the number of new students we may admit each year. The admissions committee has the difficult task of selecting students with the strongest overall records from a large pool of well-qualified applicants. Unfortunately, this may result in not being able to accept many applicants who are capable of excellent academic work.
We appreciate the interest you have shown in UC Berkeley and wish you success in achieving your academic goals."""
