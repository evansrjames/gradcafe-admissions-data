Around €20,000 each for the first two years and around €15,000 each for the last two years before a 11.41% deduction to the social security. Plus, you have an option to earn extra money from TA/RA work from year 2 onwards. 

I personally got an offer of admission from a top 35 business school in the US, but politely turned it down and chose Bocconi. This is mainly because they gave me full funding in the form of big assistantships that would require me to work 20 hours a week during term time, and a (very) small scholarship."

The quality and size of this year’s applicant pool presented us with some very difficult decisions, and we have had to deny admission to many qualified applicants.

If I were you, I will talk to my advisors (those who wrote my rec letters), talk to the doctoral students of the school that you are deciding between, and follow my gut at the end.

Ryerson definitely has a problem with their admission process and I begin to suspect some kind of fraud. Each time, I have only received notifications right after I called. 

I was told a decision was made by the committee since March and this was not communicated to me for no reason at all. After I called I was sent a rejection email. 

There is no reason why international applications close relatively early and people still do not know their status by now. 

I will advice everybody to simply call them to get your status. 

We should consider starting an online campaign on Ryerson. You can not simply run a shabby admission process knowing full well the aim is simply to collect as much application fee as possible with limited space for students. This is not a matter of stiff competition, I do not think most domestic students and a lot of international students applied to Ryerson as their first choice."

The competition for admission was very strong, as we received over 1100 applications for about 20 openings in our program. If you indicated a second-choice major we considered you for that area as well and our decision also applies to that area.
We appreciate your interest in our program and wish you much success in the future."

I am certain that you will find a productive setting in which to continue your studies among the many other good graduate schools, and I wish you success in your subsequent professional career.

This year's pool of applicants was both very large and highly competitive, and our review of applicants' credentials and interests left us with difficult decisions. Graduate admissions decisions are based on the applicants' preparation for advanced study and on judgments about their strength relative to other applicants in the pool.  The deliberations also consider how applicants and their proposed areas of study and research match up with faculty and with other resources and opportunities available at Emory over the next several years.  All applicants' files, including yours, received a thorough review, and after careful consideration we have decided not to extend you an offer of admission.

If you have any questions about the decision, please contact your program directly.

Thank you for your interest, and for taking the time to apply to the Laney Graduate School at Emory University.  I am sure you are pursuing other options as well, and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

Sincerely,
Lisa A. Tedesco, PhD"""

I have not heard about my application yet! I have emailed and called them thousands of times and no answer! Butttttt finally someone answered my phone this week! A rude and impolite woman that explained that if there was any information, she would have known! She added that she could not do anything more. She didn't know with whom I may contact. She didn't know how long I should wait. She didn't know ....
Indeed she did know all of them but she loved being rude and unhelpful!

However this is just fun for me! I have already accepted an offer from a top 10 school and continue calling UNC just to have an estimation of how much unprofessional a program may be.

We regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you admission at this time.

 

We did a comprehensive analysis of all of the candidates who applied to our program. We used the following criteria in evaluating the applications: (1) undergraduate record; (2) graduate record (if any); (3) GMAT/GRE scores and TOEFL/IELTS scores (where applicable); (4) ability to profit from academic work at the Ph.D. level, as evidenced by letters of recommendation, academic and business experience, and/or interviews; (5) interest in, and background to undertake an intensive research program; and (6) fit of academic and research interests between the applicant and the relevant faculty group. We do not use any single criterion to reach our decision. With nearly 500 applications and only a few openings in each area of study, over 95% of our applicants, many with excellent qualifications, had to be turned away.

 

We regret that we were unable to admit you to our program. We wish you well in your work and hope that you find it possible to continue your education elsewhere. Indeed, we hope to see you in our profession someday soon.
